# Service Structure Explanation

## 🤔 **Why You Had Both `services` and `api` Folders**

### **The Problem:**

You had both folders because:

1. **`src/api/`** - Real API integration files (production-ready)
2. **`src/services/`** - Mock data service (development-only)

This created confusion about which one to use and when.

## ✅ **New Unified Structure**

### **Before (Confusing):**

```
src/
├── api/                    # Real API services
│   ├── auth.ts
│   ├── borrowers.ts
│   ├── loans.ts
│   └── config.ts
└── services/
    └── dataService.ts      # Mock service
```

### **After (Clear):**

```
src/
└── services/
    ├── api/                # Real API services (production)
    │   ├── auth.ts
    │   ├── borrowers.ts
    │   ├── loans.ts
    │   └── config.ts
    ├── mock/               # Mock services (development)
    │   ├── dataService.ts
    │   └── README.md
    ├── index.ts            # Main service exports
    └── README.md           # Documentation
```

## 🎯 **Clear Purpose**

### **`services/api/` - Production Services**

- **Real HTTP requests** to backend
- **Authentication** and error handling
- **Production-ready** code
- **Used when backend is available**

### **`services/mock/` - Development Services**

- **JSON data files** as data source
- **Simulated API calls** with delays
- **No backend required**
- **Used during development**

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Recommended (Automatic):**

```typescript
import { service } from "@/services";

// This automatically uses the right service
const borrowers = await service.getBorrowersAsync({
  page: 1,
  limit: 10,
  kycStatus: "verified",
});
```

### **Direct Access (If Needed):**

```typescript
// For mock data (development)
import { dataService } from "@/services/mock/dataService";

// For real API (production)
import { borrowersApi } from "@/services/api/borrowers";
```

## 🔄 **Environment Switching**

### **Development Mode (Current):**

```typescript
// src/services/index.ts
import { dataService } from "./mock/dataService";
export const service = dataService;
```

### **Production Mode (Future):**

```typescript
// src/services/index.ts
import { borrowersApi, loansApi } from "./api";
export const service = {
  getBorrowersAsync: borrowersApi.getBorrowers,
  getLoansAsync: loansApi.getLoans,
  // ... other methods
};
```

## 📊 **Benefits of New Structure**

### ✅ **Clear Separation**

- Mock services for development
- API services for production
- No confusion about which to use

### ✅ **Easy Switching**

- Change one file to switch environments
- No need to update imports everywhere
- Consistent interface across services

### ✅ **Better Organization**

- Related services grouped together
- Clear documentation for each type
- Easy to find and maintain

### ✅ **Future-Proof**

- Easy to add new services
- Scalable architecture
- Ready for production deployment

## 🔧 **Migration Complete**

### **What Changed:**

1. **Moved** `src/api/*` → `src/services/api/`
2. **Moved** `src/services/dataService.ts` → `src/services/mock/`
3. **Created** unified service exports in `src/services/index.ts`
4. **Updated** imports in components to use new structure

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Update imports** in your components (already done for Borrowers List)
2. **Use the main service** import: `import { service } from '@/services'`
3. **No other changes needed** - everything else works the same

## 🎯 **Current Status**

### **✅ Working Now:**

- Mock services for development
- JSON data files
- All existing functionality
- TypeScript support

### **🚀 Ready for Future:**

- Real API integration
- Production deployment
- Environment switching
- Scalable architecture

## 📝 **Summary**

**Before:** Confusing dual structure with unclear purposes
**After:** Clean, organized structure with clear separation of concerns

**Result:** You now have a professional, scalable service architecture that's easy to understand and maintain! 🎉
