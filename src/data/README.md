## üîß Usage

### Direct Import

```typescript
import borrowersData from "@/data/borrowers.json";
import loansData from "@/data/loans.json";
```

### Through Data Service

```typescript
import { dataService } from "@/services/dataService";

// Get borrowers with filtering and pagination
const response = await dataService.getBorrowersAsync({
  page: 1,
  limit: 10,
  kycStatus: "verified",
  search: "John",
});

// Get statistics
const stats = await dataService.getBorrowerStatisticsAsync();

## üöÄ Features

### Data Service Integration

The data service provides:

- **Async Methods**: Simulate API calls with delays
- **Filtering**: Search, status, and other filters
- **Pagination**: Page-based data loading
- **Sorting**: Configurable sorting options
- **Statistics**: Real-time calculated statistics
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

### Real-time Statistics

Statistics are calculated dynamically from the data:

- Total counts and percentages
- Financial summaries
- Performance metrics
- Trend analysis

### Filtering and Search

Support for multiple filter types:

- Text search across multiple fields
- Status-based filtering
- Date range filtering
- Relationship-based filtering

## üîÑ Data Updates

To update the demo data:

1. **Edit JSON Files**: Modify the relevant JSON files directly
2. **Update Statistics**: Statistics are calculated automatically
3. **Maintain Relationships**: Ensure IDs match across related data
4. **Test Changes**: Use the data service to verify updates

## üìù Best Practices

### Data Consistency

- Use consistent ID formats across all files
- Maintain referential integrity between related data
- Use realistic and varied data for testing

### Performance

- Keep JSON files reasonably sized for development
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement proper filtering to reduce data transfer

### Type Safety

- Always use TypeScript interfaces
- Validate data structure in the data service
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully

## üß™ Testing

The data files are designed for:

- **Development**: Local development and testing
- **Demo**: Showcasing application features
- **Prototyping**: Rapid feature development
- **Unit Testing**: Mock data for tests

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- **Data Validation**: JSON schema validation
- **Data Generation**: Automated test data generation
- **Data Seeding**: Database seeding scripts
- **Data Migration**: Tools for data structure changes
- **Data Export**: Export functionality for data files
